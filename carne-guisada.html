            <li>1 medium green bell pepper (chopped)</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
            <li>3 large roma tomatoes (diced)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons cumin (ground)</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 cube beef bouillon</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour (or more for thicker gravy)</li>
            <li>3-4 cups beef broth (low sodium)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh cilantro (chopped, for garnish)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Sear the beef.</strong> Add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil to a large skillet 
                    and heat over medium-high heat. Add the stew meat and cook until browned on 
                    all sides, about 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the beef to a plate and set aside. 
                    You might have to do this in batches, you don't want to overcrowd 
                    the meat in the pan. If doing in batches, only add 1 tablespoon of oil 
                    at a time.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the veggies.</strong> Drizzle the remaining olive oil to the skillet. Add the onion,
                     bell pepper and cook for about 3 minutes until the onion becomes translucent.
                      Add the garlic and cook for
                     another minute until aromatic. Stir in the tomatoes and cook for another minute.</li>
                <li><strong>Add the spices.</strong> Season with salt, pepper,
                     cumin and chili powder. Stir well.Add the 
                     tomato paste and crumble
                     up the beef bouillon, stir, scraping up the 
                     browned bits from the bottom of the pan.</li>
                <li><strong>Start the gravy.</strong> Sprinkle the flour over the veggies and stir well while cooking for
                     another 1 to 2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste. Add a cup of the beef 
                     broth and stir everything together. The mixture should start to thicken 
                     from the flour.</li>
                <li><strong></strong>Add the beef and cook.</strong> Add the beef back to the skillet then another 
                    2 cups of beef broth, stir until combined. Cover and cook for 1 and a 
                    half hours or more until the meat falls apart, over low heat, stirring
                     occasionally. Add more beef broth if gravy is too thick.</li>
                <li><strong>Garnish and serve.</strong> Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt and pepper 
                    as needed. Garnish with cilantro and serve alongside with rice and 
                    tortillas.</li>
            </ol>
